# Student portal Project

## Description
This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, providing endpoints for managing users, doctors, courses, and schedules. It uses **Knex.js** as a query builder for interacting with the database and includes features for user authentication, data validation, file uploads, and schedule management. The API supports functionalities such as user creation, course management, and schedule conflict detection.

## Features
- **User Management**: Create, update, and delete users (students, doctors, and admins).
- **Authentication**: Uses JWT for securing endpoints.
- **Course Management**: API endpoints for managing course data.
- **Schedule Management**: APIs for managing and validating course schedules.
- **Validation**: Input validation using **Joi**.
- **File Uploads**: Supports image uploads (e.g., doctor's photos) using **Multer**.
- **Password Security**: Hashing of passwords using **bcrypt**.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime.
- **Express**: Web framework.
- **Knex.js**: SQL query builder.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database.
- **Joi**: Validation library.
- **JWT**: Authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Multer**: Middleware for file uploads.
- **Bcrypt**: Password hashing.
- **dotenv**: For environment variable management.
